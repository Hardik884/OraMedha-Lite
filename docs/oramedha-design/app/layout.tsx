          NO PRODUCT ANALYTICS HERE, DELIBERATELY.

          The Vercel Analytics component used to be mounted at this point.
          The root layout wraps EVERY route in the product, so it ran on the
          patient portal and on every clinical screen — and those URLs carry
          record identifiers in the path (/portal/billing/{treatmentId},
          /dentist/patients/{id}, /dentist/treatments/{id}). That made page
          paths derived from patient and treatment records a third-party
          disclosure, with no notice, no consent and no processing agreement.

          There is no marketing surface in this repository to scope it to — the
          marketing site is a separate application (oramedha.com) and is free to
          carry its own analytics. So the correct scope inside the PMS is none.

          If product telemetry is wanted later, it must not be mounted here:
          instrument specific non-clinical events server-side with identifiers
          the vendor cannot resolve back to a patient, and record the vendor in
          docs/subprocessors.json first.
